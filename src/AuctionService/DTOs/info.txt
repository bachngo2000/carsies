Right now, our web API exposes the database entities to the client. The client receives data that maps directly to your database tables. However, that's not always a good idea. Sometimes you want to change the shape of the data that you send to client. For example, you might want to:

    Remove circular references (see previous section).
    Hide particular properties that clients are not supposed to view.
    Omit some properties in order to reduce payload size.
    Flatten object graphs that contain nested objects, to make them more convenient for clients.
    Avoid "over-posting" vulnerabilities. (See Model Validation for a discussion of over-posting.)
    Decouple your service layer from your database layer.
    
To accomplish this, you can define a data transfer object (DTO). A DTO is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network.

In this project, what we want to return from our API endpoints, in terms of an AuctionDTO, effectively, this is just the auction and the item mostly combined.

AuctionDTO is an object that's been flattended into a single object from the auction and item objects =? go from our auction and item entities into an AuctionDTO
