AuctionCreated.cs, AuctionUpdated.cs, and AuctionDeleted.cs represent our different events that we're going to send onto the service bus

So, we need to emit events for certain types and remember the goal of what we're doing here. These are often referred to as integration events
because we want one service, in this case the Auction service, to send an event onto the service bus. And the goal of this is so that our search 
service database is going to be eventually consistent with what's happening inside the Auction service. Remember, these are asynchronous messages. 
We can't guarantee that they're going to arrive instantly in the Search service, nor can we guarantee the order they're going to arrive in either
